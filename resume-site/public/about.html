  <h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Honest, open, and compromisable are three traits I'd use to best explain the values that I strive to live by. I've realized in life making one person happy will usually upset another in some way or form. I beleive relationships are important in life and tending to them are an important part of a satisfying life in love, friendships, and business.</p>
